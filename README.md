# What is TSCord

#### **TSCord** is a fully-featured **[discord bot](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro#bots-and-apps)** *template* written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), intended to provide a framework that's easy to use, extend and modify.

It uses [`discordx`](https://github.com/discordx-ts/discordx) and [`discord.js v14`](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js) under the hood to simplify the development of discord bots.

This template was created to give developers a starting point for new Discord bots, so that much of the initial setup can be avoided and developers can instead focus on meaningful bot features. Developers can simply follow the [installation](https://tscord.discbot.app/docs/bot/get-started/installation) and the [configuration](https://tscord.discbot.app/docs/bot/get-started/configuration) instructions, and have a working bot with many boilerplate features already included!
